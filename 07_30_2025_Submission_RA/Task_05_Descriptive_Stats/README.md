# Research-Analyst Work Syracuse University

The goal of this task is to try out a LLM Model Like GPT, Claude or Any of the models available and ask questions about a dataset to the model. 
Hence, I took a dataset of Cricket, which is popular sport in my home country and asked questions to models Like ChatGpt, below is a summarized version of my analysis. 

#### Dataset info:
 It’s a decent size dataset which talks about ICC Cricket World Cup 2024 year. It contains match level statistics until the final match. 
Using this Dataset, I have asked ChatGpt some questions in natural language. 

#### Models Tested: 
1.	ChatGpt – O3 :- Very Advanced reasoning feature + Internet search 
2.	ChatGpt – 4O :- General purpose tasks
3.	 ChatGpt – 4O-Mini :- Some level of Reasoning 
4.	ChatGpt – 4O-Mini High :- Some level of Faster Reasoning  + Internet Search

#### Questions:
1.	Which Player has the most Player of The Match title?
2.	Which Player is the Best Bowler across all matches?
3.	Across the Top Scorer per match, who is the one name that we see frequently?
4.	What is the most Toss Decision teams are choosing?
5.	Which team won most of the matches?
6.	What is the top venue based on matches played?
7.	What is that one team that has won most of their Tosses?
8.	On Monday, June 3rd of 2024, there was a match between South Africa and Sri Lanka. Can you summarize the outcome & stats for that match.
9.	As a Team India's Head Coach, I want to know for the Next Year World Cup Who might be my team’s opponent for the Semi Finals, & Finals. Also, what are my team’s chances to win it?  


## Summary of Results:
Overall, I would say ChatGpt’s O3 version outperformed all the other versions, when it comes to Semantic Reasoning, Advanced Reasoning (deterministic statistics for a reason from gpt), Internet search + Future Predictions based on advanced reasoning & Past Data.

Gpt-4o is normally suited for small general tasks, where we can get a result by small operation like, Finding A or B won the specific match, Count of matches played at a venue etc. It could not answer well on questions like “Top scorer of the games” Etc, & Questions which would require semantic/advanced reasoning. 

Gpt-4o-mini: This version of the model was decent, it’s almost comparable to O-3 model, but this doesn’t go in depth of reasoning, and it won’t try to do internet search when it doesn’t know the answer.

Gpt-4o-mini-high: This version of the model was decent too, it’s almost comparable to O-3 model in terms of internet search & decent reason capabilities (no-depth of reasoning).


My Ranking Order would be (if Futuristic Predictions matter too with some solid reasoning):
O3 >>>> 4o-mini-high >>> 4o-mini >>>>> 4o
