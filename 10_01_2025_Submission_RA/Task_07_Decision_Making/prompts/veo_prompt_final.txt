A cinematic, hyperrealistic 8-second steadicam shot in Times Square, NYC at dusk. The camera follows a street interviewer with a microphone asking a quick question (What is Data Wrangling in Data Analysis) to a sharp, casually dressed data scientist. The data scientist nods, then answers confidently with a clear, concise hand gesture for emphasis. The interviewer smiles and gives an impressed nod. The background is a vibrant, bokeh blur of massive glowing billboards and bustling crowds.
